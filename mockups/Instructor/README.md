# 👤 USER STORY: THE INSTRUCTOR

## 1. THE BIG PICTURE: WHAT DO I NEED TO DO?

I need to know who and what type of diver I'm taking, when and where we're going, and that they're cleared to dive.

**I am Instructor: Riya Lee**
Required before I can be assigned to any Booking, but not required on sign up: Instructor Profile Form. This will include my PADI Pro Number, my active teaching status, my spoken languages, and my specialties (e.g., Deep Diver, Nitrox), contact information.

## 2. To be an Instructor, I need to achieve three specific tasks:

### 1. **Verify Customer's Readiness**

I need to know:

- That my customer has signed all the forms
- How much of the learning they've completed
- Customer specifics (i.e. food allergies, macro lover, special camera)

### 2. **Manage My Demand**

- I need to set when I do/not want to work
- I need Booking Owners to know my specialties
- I need to list my experiences

### 3. **Exit Interview Customer**

I need to:

- Debrief the customer, including logging
- Flag anything that went wrong

## 3. Tools to help me be an Instructor

### 1. Updated personal Calendar

I need a dashboard that tells me everything I need to manage for the week.
It need a calendar that tells me what my Bookings are for this week.
It needs to tell me of any changes to the Bookings.

### 2. Updated personal requirements

I should be able to set how much I want to make for each type of customer
I really like fun dives and would like to be assigned more
I really dislike long days and would like to be assigned less

### 3. Auto assigning Bookings

During the Booking process, Stakeholders should be able to automatically select me

### 4. Cancellation

New Instructor should be auto-assigned and Booking Owner notified.

## 5. Notes for AI

- The goal is I don't have to be contacted about work. I just look at my dashboard and know if I have work or not.
- I do not have a network to contact the Booking Owner to verify my availability.
- I need Booking Owners to know I am the only Spanish-speaking instructor here.
- I should have streamlined tools for debriefing the customer.
