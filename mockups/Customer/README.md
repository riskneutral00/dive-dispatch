# 👤 USER STORY: THE CUSTOMER

## 1. THE BIG PICTURE: WHAT DO I NEED TO DO?

I need to sign up for my dives, pay easily, and know when to get picked up and dropped off.

**I am Customer: Karen**
Required before Booking can transition from Draft to Pending: Customer Profile Form.
This will include my personal contact, medical form, and liability form.

## 2. To be a Customer, I need to achieve three specific tasks:

### 1. **Complete Customer Profile Form Paperwork**

I need to know:

- That my customer contact medical liability forms are complete and payment is made
- The options and details of my dive itinerary

### 2. **Access My Itinerary**

I need to:

- Know exactly what time the boat or pickup leaves and from where
- Know who my instructor is

## 3. Tools to help me be a Customer

### 1. Frictionless Customer Portal

I need a mobile-friendly dashboard that gives me a simple checklist of what I owe the Dive Center (Forms, Money).
It needs to give me my final itinerary once everything is green.

### 2. Profile Memory

I should be able to save my gear sizing and cert numbers so I never have to type them again.
I really dislike doing physical paperwork on a clipboard on a rocking boat. -->

### 3. Auto-reminders

I need to be reminded if:

- There are any forms that have not been completed.
- The time to meet transport
- To review my experiences

## 4. Cancellation

I must contact the booking owner for them to cancel and follow their cancellation policies.

## 5. Notes for AI

- I must be able to complete all forms without signing in to the app
- No logins or passwords should be strictly required just to sign a form—use secure magic links (`/book/[token]/medical`) to reduce friction.
- After the customer profile form is complete, then I can be asked if I want to sign up for an account.
- After the dive is complete, if I don't have an account yet, I can be reminded to make one.
