# 👤 USER STORY: THE DIVE SITE OPERATOR

## 1. THE BIG PICTURE: WHAT DO I NEED TO DO?

I need to regulate access to the marine park/dive site, ensure environmental compliance, and prevent dangerous overcrowding.

**I am Dive Site Operator Capt. Silva**
Required before I can be assigned to any Booking, but not required on sign up: DiveSite Profile Form. This will include my daily diver quotas, permit requirements, depth limits, and current conditions.

<!-- v 1.5

## 2. To be a Dive Site Operator, I need to achieve three specific tasks:

### 1. **Enforce Site Quotas**

I need to know:

- How many boats and divers are scheduled to arrive today
- That no one is exceeding my maximum daily environmental limit

### 2. **Broadcast Conditions**

- I need to set the status of the site (Open, Closed, Warning)
- I need Booking Owners to know if there are strong currents or poor visibility

### 3. **Verify Permits and Rules**

I need to:

- Ensure only certified/cleared divers are being brought to restricted sites
- Flag boats or centers that violate park rules

## 3. Tools to help me be a Dive Site Operator

### 1. Site Capacity Dashboard

I need a dashboard that shows me the daily manifest of expected arrivals.
It needs a calendar that tracks long-term booking pressure on the site.

### 2. Condition Toggle

I should be able to instantly change the status of the dive site (e.g., Red Flag).
I really dislike when boats show up during dangerous conditions because they didn't get the memo.

### 3. Auto-blocking Bookings

During the Booking process, if my quota is reached, my site must disappear from the available options.
If I close the site due to weather, all affected Bookings should be automatically notified to select a backup site.

## 4. Notes for AI

- I am the ultimate authority on whether the dive happens at my location.
- The system must treat my "Closed" status as a hard block that cascades down to the Customer, Boat, and Instructor instantly. -->
