# 👤 USER STORY: THE CompressorOPERATOR

## 1. THE BIG PICTURE: WHAT DO I NEED TO DO?

I need to prepare enough gas for my customers.

**I am CompressorOperator Weezing**
Required before I can be assigned to any Booking, but not required on sign up: CompressorProfile Form. This will include my total available gas mixes, filling policies, and operating hours.

## 2. To be a CompressorOperator, I need to achieve three specific tasks:

### 1. **Manage Gas Mixes**

I need to know:

- How much of each type of gas is needed weekly.

## 3. Cancellation

New CompressorOperator should be auto assigned and Booking Owner notified.

## 4. Notes for AI

- The goal is that I never have to answer the phone to tell someone if the Compressoris busy. They just look at the system.
- If I click a button to close the Compressorfor an emergency, the system must automatically notify all affected stakeholders to reschedule.
