# 👤 USER STORY: THE BOAT OPERATOR

## 1. THE BIG PICTURE: WHAT DO I NEED TO DO?

I need an accurate manifest to make sure my Customers return from their dives safely.

**I am BoatOperator M.V. Black Pearl**
Required before I can be assigned to any Booking, but not required on sign up: Boat Profile Form. This will include my maximum passenger capacity, tank stations, docking location, and available amenities.

## 2. To be a BoatOperator, I need to achieve two specific tasks:

### 1. **Manage Manifests**

I need to know:

- The exact headcount of Customers and staff expected today
- Any special needs (e.g., wheelchair access, vegetarian lunches)
- Emergency Services Contact

### 2. **Control My Logistics**

- I need to set my departure times and return times
- I need Booking Owners to know my route availabiltiy
- I need to set where everybody sets their gear
- I need to set where everybody sits dry

<!-- v2
- I need to know what amenities need to be refilled -->

## 3. Tools to help me be a BoatOperator

### 1. Updated personal Calendar

I need a dashboard that tells me everything I need to manage for the week.
It needs a calendar that tells me what all my bookings are for the week.
It needs to tell me of any changes to the bookings.
It needs to tell me of any special requirements (i.e. sidemount, multiple drop-offs).

### 2. Auto assigning Customers

I should be able to tell what assortment of Customers (FD, OW, DSD etc.) I have according to the manifest.
I should have auto assigned seating for my Customers.
I should be able to have manual override of suggested Customers seating.

### 3. Daily Manifest Dashboard

I need a dashboard that gives me a clear, printable/mobile checklist of passengers.
It needs to tell me of any last-minute cancellations or additions before I depart.

## 4. Cancellation

New Boat Operator should be auto-assigned to the Customers and Booking Owner notified.

## 5. Notes for AI

<!-- v2
