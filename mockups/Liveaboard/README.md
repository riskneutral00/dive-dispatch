# 👤 USER STORY: LIVEABOARD

## 0. Follows DiveCenter and DiveResort skeletons, with additions

## 1. THE BIG PICTURE: WHAT DO I NEED TO DO?

I also need to manage complex, multi-day itineraries at sea, including cabin assignments, CompressorOperator onboard, and ensure a week's worth of logistics are perfectly coordinated.

**I am Liveaboard Operator: Sarah**
Required before I can be assigned to any Booking, but not required on sign up: Liveaboard Profile Form. This will include my tank stations, cabin types (Master, Twin), trip schedules (e.g., 7-day Northern Route), and total capacity.

## 2. To be a Liveaboard, I need to achieve three specific tasks:

### 1. **Follow everything in DiveCenter, BoatOperator, CompressorOperator, DiveResort**

I am basically all four of these stakeholders combined and stuck on the water

### 2. **Track Multi-Day Logistics**

- I need to ensure we have enough gear, gas, and food for customers for the entire duration

### 3. **Coordinate Staffing**

I need to:

- Know which instructors and crew are assigned to this specific week-long trip
- Ensure all paperwork is 100% complete before we leave the harbor (no internet at sea)

## 3. Tools to help me be a Liveaboard

### 1. Trip Overview Dashboard

I need a dashboard that manages the trip as a single massive event containing many Bookings.
It needs to show me the overall completion of forms for everyone on the trip.

### 2. Visual Cabin Map

I should be able to see my boat's layout and assign Bookings to specific rooms.
I really dislike when double bookings happen; the system must rigidly lock a cabin once sold.

### 3. Auto-bundling Requirements

During the Booking process, a Liveaboard selection should automatically trigger requirements for passport info, dietary needs, and nitrox certifications.
If a customer cancels, their cabin should instantly unlock for the global network to sell.

## 4. Notes for AI

- A Liveaboard booking is high-stakes. The "Pending" state might last for months as customers pay installments.
- Offline capability is crucial. Once the trip departs, I need to view the manifest and forms without internet access.
