# 👤 USER STORY: THE POOL OPERATOR

## 1. THE BIG PICTURE: WHAT DO I NEED TO DO?

I need to maximize the use of my pool for training dives without overcrowding the water or creating safety hazards.

**I am Pool Operator Zac**
Required before I can be assigned to any Booking, but not required on sign up: Pool Profile Form. This will include my total capacity, depth, and operating hours.

Shade, beer, food

## 2. To be a Pool Operator, I need to achieve three specific tasks:

### 1. **Manage Capacity**

I need to know:

- How many total students and instructors are in the water at any given hour

### 2. **Control My Schedule**

- I need to block out times for maintanence
- I need Booking Owners to know my opening and closing times
- I need to let other stakeholders know when my pool is in high demand.

### 3. **Verify Authorized Users**

I need to:

- Know which Dive Centers and Instructors are authorized to use my facility
<!-- v2 - Track usage for billing purposes -->

## 3. Tools to help me be a Pool Operator

### 1. Updated Facility Calendar

I need a dashboard that tells me everything I need to manage for the week.
It needs to show pool density throughout the day, and by which DiveCenters and Instructors - shareable with Stakeholders.
It needs to alert me of any cancellations so I can free up the space.

## 4. Cancellation

New PoolOperator should be auto-assigned and Booking Owner notified.

## 5. Notes for AI

- The goal is that I never have to answer the phone to tell someone if the pool is busy. They just look at the system.
- If I click a button to close the pool for an emergency, the system must automatically notify all affected stakeholders to reschedule.
