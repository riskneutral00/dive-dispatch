# 👤 USER STORY: THE DIVE RESORT

## 1. THE BIG PICTURE: WHAT DO I NEED TO DO?

I need to seamlessly link a customer's land-based accommodation with their daily dive schedule.

**I am Resort Manager Leo**
Required before I can be assigned to any Booking, but not required on sign up: Resort Profile Form. This will include my room types (dorm, private), nightly rates, and check-in/out times.

## 2. To be a Dive Resort, I need to achieve three specific tasks:

### 1. **Manage Room Inventory**

I need to know:

- Which beds or rooms are available on specific dates
- Who is checking in and checking out today

### 2. **Sync with Dive Schedules**

- I need to know if a customer's dive course extends so I can automatically extend their room
- I need Booking Owners to know if I am fully booked so they stop selling "Stay & Dive" packages

### 3. **Track Package Fulfillment**

I need to:

- Verify that a customer arriving for a bed is actually tied to a valid Dive Booking
- Flag customers who have checked out of the room but left gear in the lockers

## 3. Tools to help me be a Dive Resort

### 1. Occupancy Calendar

I need a dashboard that tells me my bed availability for the month.
It needs to show me the link between a bed assignment and the customer's dive itinerary.

### 2. Dynamic Room Constraints

I should be able to link minimum stays to specific dive courses.
I really dislike when dive schedules change and the accommodation isn't notified.

### 3. Auto-assigning Beds

During the Booking process, if a "Stay & Dive" package is selected, a bed should be automatically reserved for the duration of the course.
If the dive dates shift, the system should attempt to auto-shift the bed dates.

## 4. Notes for AI

- This stakeholder acts similarly to a standard hotel PMS (Property Management System) but is strictly subservient to the Dive Booking. The Dive dictates the Stay.
- The UI should clearly delineate between "Dorm Beds" and "Private Rooms" as resources.
