## The Pyramid

Five layers, built bottom-up. Each layer generates value and data for the next.

```
           /\
          /  \
         / IN \        5. INSURANCE
        /------\
       /  TREAS \      4. TREASURY
      /----------\
     /   MARKET   \    3. MARKETPLACE
    /--------------\
   / REPRODUCIBLE   \  2. REPRODUCIBLE
  /------------------\
 /   DIVE DISPATCH    \ 1. BASE
/______________________\
```

1. **Dive Dispatch (Base)** — Operational platform for the dive industry. Connects dive centers and stakeholders into one workflow. Planning, communication, compliance, admin reduction.

2. **Reproducible** — Extend the proven DiveDispatch model into other activity-based tourism verticals: skiing, run clubs, yoga retreat, climbing, surfing, motorbike, etc. Same core data model and workflows, adapted per vertical.

3. **Marketplace** — Expose verified operators to a public directory and booking layer. Real operational data powers trustworthy listings, real-time availability, and multilingual support.

4. **Treasury** — Internal treasury for cash reserves via government note investments, liquidity management including cash advances and loans, and buying power for bulk equipment.

5. **Insurance** — Embed or partner for insurance products and creation of completely new products impossible before gathering pyramid of data.

## The Insight

Power has shifted to individuals (influencers, personal brands) but infrastructure has not. Margins are thinner, expectations are rising, and the coordination failures that were once tolerable now erode into structural failures.

Diving exposes multi-stakeholder coordination failures most clearly. The same model applies directly to ski resorts, surf schools, motorbike rentals, and other adventure tourism verticals. 
Prove it in diving. Replicate it everywhere.
